C. A. R. Hoare##There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.;;
Edsger Dijkstra##If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.;;
Bill Gates##Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.;;
Bob Gray##Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed.;;
Brian W. Kernighan##Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.;;
Martin Golding##Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.;;
Bjarne Stroustrup##C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.;;
Richard Pattis##When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code.;;
Eric S. Raymond##Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.;;
Linus Torvalds##Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.;;
Martin Fowler##Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.;;
Steve McConnel##Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?;;
Larry Wall##The problem with using C++ is that there's already a strong tendency in the language to require you to know everything before you can do anything.;;
Donald Knuth##People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.;;
Ken Thompson##One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.;;
Ralph Johnson##Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.;;

Dan Salomon##Sometimes it pays to stay in bed in Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code.;;
Bill Bryson##And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.;;
Brian Bernighan & Rob Pike##Another effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you." This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor.;;
Doug Linder##A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.;;
Frederick Brooks, Jr##All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.;;
Edsger Dijkstra##The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.;;

The Washington Post Magazine, 9 June 1985##At Group L, Stoffel oversees six first-rate programmers, a managerial challenge roughly equivalent to herding cats.;;
Author Unknown##It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature.;;
Fred Blechman##Version 1 of any software is full of bugs. Version 2 fixes all the bugs and is great. Version 3 adds all the things users ask for, but hides all the great stuff in Version 2.;;
Paul Graham, "Hackers and Painters," 2003##Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I'm not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.;;
Jessica Gaston##One man's crappy software is another man's full time job.;;
John Moore##He who hasn't hacked assembly language as a youth has no heart. He who does so as an adult has no brain.;;
Richard Pattis##If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, e.g., with no external memory aids, you are not ready to code it.;;
Nathaniel S. Borenstein##It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.;;
Doug Vargas##It's easy to cry "bug" when the truth is that you've got a complex system and sometimes it takes a while to get all the components to co-exist peacefully.;;
Robert Sewell##If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution.;;
Joseph Campbell##A computer is like an Old Testament god, with a lot of rules and no mercy.;;

C. A. R. Hoare##We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.;;
Robert Firth##One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that lacking zero they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs.;;
Harlan Mills##Programming is similar to a game of golf. The point is not getting the ball in the hole but how many strokes it takes.;;
Author Unknown##Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.;;
Richard Pattis##Programming languages, like pizzas, come in only two sizes: too big and too small.;;
Edgser Dijkstra##It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC. As potential programmers, they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.;;
Rich Cook##Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.;;
Author Unknown##Programs for sale: fast, reliable, cheap - choose two.;;
Bob Frankston##Reusing pieces of code is like picking off sentences from other people's stories and trying to make a magazine article.;;
Author Unknown##Program, n. A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error messages; v. tr. To engage in a pastime similar to banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer opportunities for reward.;;
Stan Kelly-Bootle##Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.;;
J. Osterhout##The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state.;;
Frederick Brooks##The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.... The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.;;
Harlan Mills##The only way for errors to occur in a program is by being put there by the author. No other mechanisms are known. Programs can't acquire bugs by sitting around with other buggy programs.;;
Seymour Cray##The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it's too late.;;
Author Unknown##Constants also simplify modifying the program, should the value of pi change.;;
Alan J. Perlis##There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.;;
Lawrence Flon##There does not now, nor will there ever exist, a programming language in which it is the least bit hard to write bad programs.;;
Bill Joy##We don't manage our time as well as we manage our space. There's an overhead of starting and an overhead of stopping a project because you kind of lose your momentum. And you've got to bracket and put aside all the things you're already doing. So you need reasonably large blocks of uninterrupted time if you're going to be successful at doing some of these things. That's why hackers tend to stay up late. If you stay up late and you have another hour of work to do, you can just stay up another hour later without running into a wall and having to stop. Whereas it might take three or four hours if you start over, you might finish if you just work that extra hour. If you're a morning person, the day always intrudes a fixed amount of time in the future. So it's much less efficient. Which is why I think computer people tend to be night people - because a machine doesn't get sleepy.;;
Author Unknown##When a programming language is created that allows programmers to program in simple English, it will be discovered that programmers cannot speak English.;;
Paul Graham, "The Other Road Ahead," 2001##When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs. Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact: you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it comes off in your hand.;;
C. A. R. Hoare##You cannot teach beginners top-down programming, because they don't know which end is up.;;
Author Unknown##The New Testament offers the basis for modern computer coding theory, in the form of an affirmation of the binary number system. "But let your communication be Yea, yea; nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.;;
Douglas Adams##What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming. By the time you've sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you've certainly learned something about it yourself.;;
Chris Heilmann##Java is to JavaScript what Car is to Carpet.;;
Bill Gates##A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer.;;

Larry Niven##That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.;;
IEEE Grid news magazine##A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.;;
Peter Seebach##A hacker on a roll may be able to produce in a period of a few months something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year. IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more.;;
